# CTF Writeups

This repository contains my personal writeups for CTF platforms like
**TryHackMe** and **HackTheBox**.

The goal is to document my learning process in cybersecurity and
show a clear methodology for:

- Reconnaissance and enumeration
- Exploitation
- Privilege escalation
- Lessons learned

For now, the structure is simple:
- One folder per platform
- One folder per room/machine

I will gradually improve the structure and the level of detail as I progress.
